# World Cup 2026 Schedule Viewer

A React + Vite web app showing all 104 matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup
(USA · Canada · Mexico) in **your** timezone, with where to watch, host
city/stadium, a bracket, group standings, and live results.

🔗 **Live:** https://world-cup-viewer.netlify.app · https://ismayc.github.io/world-cup-viewer/

## Features

- **Your timezone** — kickoff times auto-convert to your detected timezone
  (switchable to 20+), with stadium-local time shown when it differs.
- **Hover for home-country time** — hover a team in any view to see when the
  match kicks off back home; countries spanning multiple time zones (USA, Brazil,
  Australia, …) list each distinct local time.
- **Follow teams** — star any team to highlight it everywhere and filter to a
  one-click "⭐ My Teams" view (saved in your browser).
- **Next-match bar** — a live countdown to the next kickoff (prioritising your
  followed teams, or "Live now"), with a jump-to-match button.
- **Four views** — chronological schedule, a Sunday–Saturday week calendar,
  group standings, and the knockout bracket.
- **Match detail** — click any match for full venue/time/broadcast info, the live
  status/clock, and a minute-by-minute event timeline (goals ⚽, cards 🟨🟥)
  once a match is underway.
- **How to watch (US)** — English (FOX/FS1) & Spanish (Telemundo/Universo) TV
  and streaming per match; free over-the-air channels flagged.
- **Venues** — all 16 host stadiums with city, country, and region.
- **Filtering** — search, stage, group, team, host country, region,
  city/stadium, timeframe, and broadcast language.
- **Group standings & qualification** — all 12 tables with official tie-breakers,
  who advances, and the 8 best third-placed teams.
- **Bracket** — two-sided knockout bracket that fills in as teams resolve.
- **Add to calendar** — per-match `.ics` download, plus a `webcal://`
  subscription feed (all matches or just your teams) that auto-updates.
- **Spoiler-free mode** — hide scores globally, per day, or per match.
- **Light/dark theme** — follows your system preference, with no flash on load.
- **Shareable URLs** — view, timezone, spoiler mode, and filters persist to the
  query string; links unfurl with a title/description preview in chat apps.
- **Accessible** — keyboard-navigable, focus-trapped modals that restore focus on
  close, and screen-reader labels on live/score badges.
- **Live results** — final scores from the [OpenFootball](https://github.com/openfootball/worldcup.json)
  public JSON feed (no API key), merged in and auto-refreshed, with a live
  in-match score + clock (incl. "HT"/stoppage) overlaid from
  [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/soccer/) while games are underway — shown across the
  Schedule, Week, and Bracket views. The Match Detail timeline lists goals and
  cards. Final scores are cross-checked against a third source
  ([TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/)) — each match shows how many
  independent sources confirm the result.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # production build to dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production build
npm test         # run the Vitest suite
```

Every push runs the tests + build in GitHub Actions; pushes to `main` deploy to
Netlify and GitHub Pages only if they pass.

## Schedule accuracy

The schedule data is validated against external sources and frozen into
[`test/fixtures/official-kickoffs.js`](./test/fixtures/official-kickoffs.js).
The test suite (75 tests) asserts every match's kickoff (to the minute, in
Eastern Time), venue, knockout-bracket slot, and group-draw assignment matches
the official schedule, plus structural invariants (complete round-robins,
simultaneous final-matchday kickoffs, no team double-booked, valid bracket
references). Sources: the [Wikipedia knockout-stage table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_FIFA_World_Cup_knockout_stage)
(kickoffs + bracket), Yahoo Sports & MLSsoccer (group times/venues), and NBC
Sports (group draw).

## Data sources

- **Schedule, groups, venues** — FIFA Final Draw (Dec 5, 2025) and official
  match schedule (see *Schedule accuracy* above).
- **Broadcast** — FOX Sports / NBCUniversal (Telemundo) US rights.
- **Results (source of record)** — OpenFootball `worldcup.json` (public domain),
  post-match final scores and goal timelines.
- **Live in-match scores** — ESPN's public scoreboard API (free, no API key,
  CORS-open). Used only while a match is underway, or just finished and
  OpenFootball hasn't posted yet; OpenFootball always wins once it has the score.
- **Backup & score cross-check** — [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/)
  (free, CORS-open, public test key). An independent third source of final
  scores. Final scores are reconciled across all three feeds: each card shows
  "✓ confirmed by N sources", or "⚠ sources disagree" when they don't, and
  `npm run check:feed` reports any mismatch. (worldcupjson.net was evaluated for
  this role and rejected — no 2026 data and no CORS, so a browser-only app can
  neither read nor validate against it.)

### Giving back to OpenFootball

OpenFootball commits results by hand, so it occasionally lags after a match.
`npm run of:edits` reuses the same three-source reconciliation to list finals
that the fallbacks already carry but OpenFootball doesn't yet — printed as
paste-ready `cup.txt` lines (`Home  FT  Away`), ranked by confidence (both
fallbacks agree / one only / they disagree), plus any match where OpenFootball
disagrees with the fallbacks. The maintainer
([openfootball/worldcup.json#23](https://github.com/openfootball/worldcup.json/issues/23))
welcomes edit-in-place fixes; this script tells you exactly which lines to fill
in at [`2026--usa/cup.txt`](https://github.com/openfootball/worldcup/blob/master/2026--usa/cup.txt).
It only reads feeds and prints — it never writes anything.

`npm run of:autofill` is the automated counterpart: it makes the same edits and
commits them to `cup.txt` for you. It's deliberately conservative — by default
only when **both** fallbacks agree on the final (and never when they *disagree*),
and only on a line still reading `Home v Away` (so re-running never double-edits).
Because TheSportsDB often posts finals tens of minutes late, there's an
**ESPN-only fallback**: once a match is ≥150 min past kickoff (≈ full time + ~30
min) and ESPN has confirmed the final while TheSportsDB still hasn't, it syncs on
ESPN alone (the commit/email note it). Half-time and goalscorers come
from ESPN and are written in the file's house style (`Home  FT (HT)  Away` +
scorer block, `(pen.)`/`(OG)` markers, CRLF-safe); if the goals don't reconcile
with the agreed final it writes a valid score-only line. **Knockouts** are
rendered in full — `1-1 a.e.t. (1-0, 1-1), 4-2 pen.` with extra-time-aware
half-time/FT-at-90 and shootout kicks excluded from the scorers; the penalty
tally is taken from ESPN and cross-checked against TheSportsDB when it carries
one (a disagreement, or a knockout whose goals can't be reconciled, is left for
manual review rather than written as a bare score). All of that formatting/placement logic lives in
[`scripts/cuptxt.mjs`](./scripts/cuptxt.mjs) and is unit-tested
([`test/cuptxt.test.js`](./test/cuptxt.test.js)). The
[workflow](./.github/workflows/openfootball-autofill.yml) runs it at ~5-minute
cadence, but **only while matches are finishing** — a coarse `*/15` trigger spins
the job up and it self-loops every ~5 min while "now" is inside a match's
finishing window (late second half through post-match confirmation, see
[`scripts/active-window.mjs`](./scripts/active-window.mjs)); outside those windows
it checks and exits in seconds. Because GitHub's scheduler is unreliable
(it can go ~2h between firings), a loop run also **re-dispatches the next one**
while another window is near, so coverage during a match day is self-sustaining
and doesn't depend on the cron (which is just a backstop); see
[`docs/autofill-scheduling.md`](./docs/autofill-scheduling.md). The scripts use
only Node built-ins + repo source — no `npm ci`. It needs an `OF_PUSH_TOKEN`
secret (push to `openfootball/worldcup`); without it — or with `DRY_RUN=1` — it
previews the edits and pushes nothing.

When the workflow actually commits a new final upstream it emails a notification
(match, commit link, run link). That step uses Gmail SMTP and is gated on a real
push, so it only fires on an actual sync; it needs `MAIL_USERNAME` (a Gmail
address) and `MAIL_PASSWORD` (a [Gmail App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords))
as repo secrets, and is skipped if they're absent.

If a **knockout** result can't be auto-synced safely (e.g. ESPN and TheSportsDB disagree on the penalty tally, or the goals don't reconcile), the workflow instead opens a deduplicated GitHub issue assigned to the maintainer — raised once, not every run — so it can be filled in by hand.
