// difference → goals scored → head-to-head). The cross-group "8 best third-
// placed teams" race is resolved with sound per-group bounds.
//
// Design rule: NEVER over-claim. When a situation is too large to enumerate
// exactly (early in the group stage there are too many permutations), or a
// competing group can't be bounded, we report nothing rather than guess. The
// goal cap is sized well above any tie-breaker-relevant margin in a 4-team
// group, so within an enumerated group the answer is exact; the only failure
// mode is staying silent (conservative), never a false "clinched".
